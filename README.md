# Threads Toolkit

Languages: [English](README.md) | [中文](README.zh-TW.md)

A powerful and reliable Apify Actor for scraping Threads.net - Meta's text-based social media platform. Extract posts, profiles, hashtags, and replies without login. Export to JSON/CSV/Excel.

## Important: Data Scraping Limitations

**Threads data scraping has inherent limitations:**

- **Data Volume Limits**: Threads platform restricts accessible data volume. Actual results vary based on account activity, content type, and other factors
- **Dynamic Loading**: Threads uses infinite scroll to load content, but stops loading after a certain amount
- **Rate Limiting**: Excessive requests may trigger platform protection mechanisms
- **Content Availability**: Cannot access private accounts, deleted content, or region-restricted content
- **Login Walls**: Threads may occasionally display login walls that block scraping

### Best Practices

1. **Small Batch Testing**: Start with smaller limits for initial tests, gradually increase to find optimal settings
2. **Realistic Expectations**: Understand that actual results may be fewer than requested
3. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle partial failures or incomplete results
4. **Execution Intervals**: Avoid overly frequent scraping; recommend at least 5-10 minute intervals
5. **Data Validation**: Always verify that scraped data is complete and accurate
6. **Backup Plans**: For critical data, consider multiple scraping attempts or different parameters

## Features

- **Search Posts**: Search for posts by keyword with sorting options
- **Hashtag Search**: Search posts by hashtag tag
- **Profile Scraping**: Fetch user profile data including bio, follower count, verification status, and recent posts
- **Single Post Extraction**: Extract detailed data from a specific post by URL, including replies
- **Batch Mode**: Process multiple keywords/usernames/tags/URLs in one run with concurrency control
- **Media Extraction**: Capture image and video URLs from posts
- **No Login Required**: Scrapes public data only
- **Export Formats**: JSON, CSV, Excel

## Input Parameters

### Common Parameters

| Field | Type | Required | Description | Default |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `action` | string | Yes | Action type: `search`, `hashtag`, `profile`, or `post` | - |
| `proxyConfiguration` | object | No | Proxy settings for reliability | Apify Proxy |

### Authentication (Optional)

Enable cookie injection for extended data access. Useful when encountering login walls.

| Field | Type | Required | Description | Default |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `useCookies` | boolean | No | Enable cookie/storage injection | `false` |
| `storageState` | object | No | Playwright `storageState.json` content | - |

**How to obtain storageState:**

1. Login to Threads in your browser
2. Use Playwright to export storage state:
   ```javascript
   // After logging in with Playwright
   await context.storageState({ path: 'storageState.json' });
   ```
3. Copy the JSON content to the `storageState` field

**Note**: If `useCookies` is enabled but `storageState` is empty, the Actor falls back to no-auth mode with a warning. Only cookies and localStorage for Threads domains are injected; sessionStorage is not supported.

### Rate Limit Protection (Optional)

Configure rate limit protection to avoid being blocked by Threads.

| Field | Type | Required | Description | Default |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `rateLimitConfig.requestDelay` | integer | No | Delay between requests (ms) | `1000` |
| `rateLimitConfig.maxRetries` | integer | No | Max retries when rate limited | `3` |
| `rateLimitConfig.backoffDelay` | integer | No | Initial backoff delay (ms) | `5000` |
| `rateLimitConfig.backoffMultiplier` | number | No | Backoff multiplier | `2` |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "action": "search",
    "keyword": "AI",
    "rateLimitConfig": {
        "requestDelay": 2000,
        "maxRetries": 5,
        "backoffDelay": 10000
    }
}
```

**How it works:**
- When Threads returns a rate limit error, the Actor automatically pauses and retries
- Uses exponential backoff: first retry after 5s, second after 10s, third after 20s (with default settings)
- Logs warnings when rate limited to help you monitor and adjust settings

Note: Recent posts from the profile page are pushed as separate Dataset items with `source: "profile_posts"` and `profile: <username>`.

## Data Quality

- **Posts**: Entries missing essential data (content, author, or valid timestamp) are filtered out and not written to the Dataset
- **Profiles**: If optional fields are missing (e.g., bio/avatar/followers), the record is kept but marked with `partial: true` and `missingFields`
- **Replies and profile posts**: Reuse the same validation; invalid ones are skipped

## Use Cases

- **Social Media Monitoring**: Track brand mentions and conversations
- **Influencer Discovery**: Find content creators by follower metrics
- **Competitor Research**: Monitor competitor activity and engagement
- **Content Analysis**: Analyze trending topics and hashtags
- **Lead Generation**: Discover profiles in your niche
- **Market Research**: Understand audience sentiment

## Performance and Limitations

**Post Limits**:

- User posts: Only recent posts accessible, quantity varies by account
- Keyword search: Limited by Threads search results
- Profile search: Limited by search results

**Note**: Threads dynamically loads content, which may limit the amount of data retrievable through scrolling. Actual results may be fewer than the requested limit.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why do I get fewer results than my maxItems limit?**
A: Threads limits the amount of content accessible through its interface. The actual number of available posts varies based on multiple factors including account activity, content type, etc.

**Q: Can I scrape private accounts?**
A: No. This Actor only scrapes publicly available data. Private accounts, deleted content, and region-restricted content cannot be accessed.

**Q: Why do some posts have truncated text?**
A: Threads displays truncated content in feeds. Use the post URL via HTTP request tools to get full content.

**Q: Are usernames with dots supported?**
A: Yes. Usernames like @user.name are fully supported.

**Q: How do I handle rate limiting?**
A: Use Apify Proxy (recommended), reduce concurrency, and add intervals between runs. If you encounter persistent issues, wait 10-15 minutes before retrying.

**Q: What happens if Threads shows a login wall?**
A: The Actor will log an error and skip that request. Consider using different proxy settings or reducing request frequency.

**Q: Can I get engagement metrics?**
A: Yes. The Actor extracts likes, replies, and reposts for each post to help you analyze content performance.

## Alternative: Official Threads API

**Important**: This Actor operates without login, meaning accessible data volume is limited by Threads' public interface.

**If you need to scrape your own account's data**, consider using the [Official Threads API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threads):

- More reliable and stable
- Higher rate limits
- Access to full post history
- No risk of being blocked
- Official support from Meta

The Threads API is the recommended method for accessing your own account data or for large-scale, production-level data extraction needs.
